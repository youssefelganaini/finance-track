# Personal Finances Tracker
As I never found any satisfactory personal expense tracking tools, I built one myself as a fun side-project. The tool has all the basic features: adding an expense, expense date and expense type (Groceries, Activities, Fixed Expenses, etc.).

I will continously add features, such as an expenses analysis so that I can find out the monthly breakdown of my expenses - but for now this is a usable version.

Built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React and Bootstrap.
